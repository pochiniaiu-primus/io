There was once a mother duck.
This mother duck had no children yet for none of her eggs had hatched.
She waited patiently day and night for her babies to hatch.
One day, as she was sitting on her nest of eggs the mother duck felt something move beneath her.
CRACK!! CRACK!! CRACK!! CRACK!!
The ugly duckling quacked.

There was once a mother duck.
This mother duck had no children yet for none of her eggs had hatched.
She waited patiently day and night for her babies to hatch.
One day, as she was sitting on her nest of eggs the mother duck felt something move beneath her.
CRACK!!  CRACK!!  CRACK!!  CRACK!!
Filled with happiness, the mother duck watched as, one by one, her eggs hatched.
She was so excited to lead her children to the pond and teach them all the ways of being a duck.
Unfortunately for the mother duck, one egg was left to hatch.
This egg was larger than the rest.  This egg was browner than the rest.
Her little ducks impatiently waited for two more days and nights.
